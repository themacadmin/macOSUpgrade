# This script was designed to be used in a Self Service policy to ensure specific
# requirements have been met before proceeding with an inplace upgrade to macOS Sierra, 
# as well as to address changes Apple has made to the ability to complete macOS upgrades 
# silently. 
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#			- Jamf Pro
#			- macOS Sierra Installer must be staged in /Applications
#				- This will be done via VPP device assignment
#				- This script shall be scoped to 10.11 Macs with macOS Sierra installer
